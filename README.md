Okay, so our shell doesn't set off any fireworks  <br />
**BUT** it can do the following things:   <br />
- take in commands seperated by semicolons (singular or double!)   <br />
- execute various commands such as: cd, ls, cat, echo, clear, exit, and more!   <br /> 
- allow any number of spaces can be placed between commands and other identifiers    <br />
